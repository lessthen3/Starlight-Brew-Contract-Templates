CONTRACT BEGINS HERE:
[Company Name Here] – Independent Contractor Agreement 
This Independent Contractor Agreement (“Agreement”) is made as of  ________________________ (the “Effective Date”) by and between:
[COMPANY], a corporation incorporated under the laws of [X COUNTRY], with its registered office at [COMPANY ADDRESS], (“Company”), and
__________________________, residing at ______________________________________ (“Contractor”).
Company and Contractor are each a “Party” and together the “Parties”.
Purpose: The following recitals are provided for context only and do not create binding obligations unless expressly stated in this Agreement.
(A) Company is developing the Project and wishes to engage Contractor to provide the Services and Deliverables.
(B) Contractor is an independent contractor and will provide the Services under the terms of this Agreement.
(C) The Parties intend that, subject to acceptance and payment as stated herein, Company will own the Deliverables and all related intellectual property rights, and that Contractor’s compensation may include fees and royalties as set out in Schedule B.
(D) The Parties enter into this Agreement to define the scope, acceptance, payment, confidentiality, intellectual property, and royalty terms for the Project.
(E) The Parties understand that Contractor intends to act as the primary artist for the Project and that the Project’s visual needs may evolve during development. The Minimum Scope in Schedule A reflects the Parties’ current best estimate of core assets for Public Release, due to the nature of early phase game development. Additional or changed assets will be handled through the Deliverable Order process, and this Agreement also explains what happens if the Parties cannot complete the Project’s visual needs together. Nothing in this Purpose section prevents Company from engaging additional contributors if needed to complete the Project.

(a) delivery and acceptance of the Minimum Scope in Schedule A, or 
(b) Company’s written notice that no further Deliverables are required.
2.3 Extension of Term: Agreement can be amended to extend the term end date if both parties consent.
2.4 Holdover. If the Term(2.1) expires and the Parties continue to perform, this Agreement continues month-to-month on the same terms.

3.4 Taxes: Contractor is solely responsible for all taxes, filings, and withholdings arising from payments under this Agreement. Company will not withhold payroll taxes unless required by law.
3.5 Invoices: Contractor will be responsible for invoicing Company per Deliverable or milestone with sufficient detail. Payment due a maximum of 14 calendar days from receipt. Section 3.5 applies to Deliverable fees; royalty payments follow Schedule B. Contractor may pause work and withhold further Deliverables if invoices are overdue. Such pause will not constitute a breach, abandonment, or unresponsiveness under Section 10.2 to the extent caused by non-payment.
3.6 Exclusivity: Contractor is not required to provide services exclusively to Company during the term of this agreement.
3.7 No Partnership: Contractor has no authority to bind Company.

4.1 Fees: Company will pay Contractor in accordance with Section 3.5, Section 10.5, and Schedule B, as applicable.
4.2 Currency and Payment:  All payments will be made in USD by electronic transfer to an account designated by Contractor.

4.3 Expenses: No expenses reimbursed unless pre-approved in writing.
4.4 Pricing Lock: The price stated in a Deliverable Order is firm. Contractor may not increase the price for that Deliverable unless the Parties agree in writing to a Deliverable Order Amendment. No retroactive price increases apply.
4.5 No Ransom: After a Deliverable Order is agreed, Contractor may not condition delivery of that Deliverable, or source files, on payment of amounts not stated in the Deliverable Order. Doing so is a material breach.

5.7 No Publicity. Contractor will not publicly announce or imply any relationship with Company or the Project, or use Company’s name or logos, without Company’s prior written consent.
6) Intellectual Property; Work Made for Hire; Assignment
6.1 Company IP: Company retains all right, title, and interest in its pre-existing IP, tools, and materials (“Company IP”).
6.2 Work Made for Hire (U.S.). To the maximum extent permitted by applicable U.S. copyright law, the Parties intend that each Deliverable is specially ordered or commissioned by Company for use as part of an audiovisual work, here meaning the Project, and constitutes a “work made for hire” under 17 U.S.C. § 101, with Company deemed the author and owner under 17 U.S.C. § 201(b).
6.3 Assignment: To the extent any Deliverable is not a “work made for hire,” Contractor hereby irrevocably assigns to Company all worldwide right, title, and interest, including all copyrights and other intellectual property rights, in and to that Deliverable. Assignment is only effective upon Company’s full payment of the applicable fees for that Deliverable, in any and all media now known or later devised, including all renewals and extensions.
6.4 Further Assurances: Contractor will sign additional documents reasonably needed to confirm Company’s ownership.
6.5 Moral Rights. To the maximum extent permitted by applicable law, Contractor irrevocably waives and agrees not to assert any moral rights, rights of attribution, rights of integrity, or similar rights in the Deliverables. Where any such rights cannot be waived, Contractor irrevocably consents to Company’s exercise of all rights in the Deliverables, including at least editing, adapting, combining with other works, resizing, and omitting or changing credit, and agrees not to assert such rights against Company or its licensees.
6.6 Contractor Background Materials. Contractor retains ownership of any pre-existing materials developed independently of this Agreement (“Background Materials”). To the extent Background Materials are incorporated into a Deliverable, Contractor grants Company a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, publicly display, and otherwise exploit such Background Materials as part of the Deliverable.
6.7 No Use Before Payment: Before acceptance and payment of a Deliverable, Contractor grants Company a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable license to internally review, test, and evaluate the Deliverable solely for acceptance decisions. Company will not publish, distribute, market, or commercially exploit the Deliverable before acceptance and payment.
7) External Tools; Third-Party Materials; Generative AI
7.1 Contractor Tools: Contractor may use Contractor’s pre-existing tools, workflows, and know-how. To the extent any Contractor tools or Background Materials are embedded in a Deliverable, Contractor grants Company a perpetual, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, publicly display, and otherwise exploit such embedded elements solely as part of the Deliverable and as necessary to exploit the Deliverable.
7.2 Contractor Will Not Include Any Third-Party Materials Unless: 
(a) The material is identified in the applicable Deliverable Order (A3) or otherwise approved by Company in writing;
(b) Properly licensed for Company’s intended commercial use;
(c) Provided to Company with proof of license and attribution requirements, if any.
7.3 Definition of Generative AI Output: “Generative AI Output” means any material generated primarily by a machine learning or generative model trained on third-party data, including any derivative output intended to substitute for human created artwork.
7.4 Generative AI Prohibition:  Contractor will not use Generative AI Output in Deliverables. Any Deliverable containing Generative AI Output constitutes a material breach and Company may terminate under Section 10.2. Contractor represents that Deliverables contain no Generative AI Output and that no generative AI tools were used to create final pixel art, concept art, or animation frames.
8) Warranties

(a) Deliverables are original and do not knowingly infringe any third-party rights;
(b) Contractor has the right to enter this Agreement and grant the rights herein;
(c) Contractor will comply with applicable laws;
(d) No malware or hidden harmful code is included in delivered files.
8.2 Remedy: If any Deliverable is alleged to infringe, Contractor will promptly, at Company’s option: 
(a) replace it with non-infringing work meeting the applicable Deliverable Order (A3) at no additional charge, or 
(b) refund amounts paid for the infringing Deliverable within 14 calendar days after Company notifies Contractor in writing of the claim.
8.3 Indemnity: Contractor will indemnify and hold harmless Company from third-party claims, damages, and reasonable legal fees arising from breach of the warranty or unauthorized third-party material included by Contractor.
8.4 Injunctive Relief: Contractor acknowledges that breach of Section 5, Section 6, or Section 7 may cause irreparable harm and Company may seek injunctive relief or other equitable relief in addition to other remedies.
9) Limitation of Liability

(b) breach of Section 6, or 
(c) obligations under Section 8.3, neither Party will be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages.
9.2 Cap: Except for the items listed in Section 9.1 and for willful misconduct or fraud, each Party’s total liability arising out of or relating to this Agreement will not exceed the total Deliverable fees paid by Company to Contractor during the 6 calendar months immediately preceding the event giving rise to the claim.
9.3 Copyright Infringement: Contractor will be responsible for costs and liabilities to the extent arising from Contractor’s breach of Sections 7 and 8, including third-party claims for infringement due to unlicensed materials, and this responsibility is not limited by Section 9.2.
10) Termination
10.1 For Convenience: Either Party may terminate this Agreement with 14 calendar days’ written notice. For clarity, a termination for convenience does not affect Vested Royalties.
10.2 Termination for Cause:
(a) Company may terminate this Agreement for cause upon written notice if Contractor:
(i) materially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure within 10 Business Days after notice; or
(ii) fails to meet 2 Delivery Dates in any rolling 60 calendar day period without an agreed written extension, except to the extent delay is caused by Company; or
(iii) fails to respond to communications reasonably necessary to perform an active Deliverable Order for 5 consecutive Business Days, without prior notice or emergency explanation, after Company provides at least 2 written follow-ups; or
(iv) rejects or fails to accept Required Deliverable Order Requests 3 times in any rolling 90 calendar day period without reasonable written justification; or
(v) ceases work on an active Deliverable Order for 10 consecutive Business Days without prior written notice and reasonable justification; or
(vi) repeatedly refuses to accept reasonable Required Deliverable Order Requests for Minimum Scope Deliverables priced at Schedule B rates, or where justified by written changes in specifications or scope agreed in a Deliverable Order Amendment priced up to 30% above Schedule B, and continues such refusal within 10 Business Days after written notice; or
(vii) refuses reasonable revisions for non-conformity pursuant to Section 1.3.
(b) Company may terminate immediately for breach of Section 5, Section 6, Section 7.4, or Section 10.7.
(c) Contractor may terminate this Agreement for cause upon written notice if Company:
(i) fails to pay any undisputed invoice within 7 calendar days after Contractor gives written notice of non-payment; or
(ii) materially breaches this Agreement and fails to cure within 10 Business Days after notice.
10.3 Effect: Company will pay for accepted Deliverables completed up to the termination date in accordance with Schedule B. Upon request, Contractor will deliver to Company all Deliverables for which Company has paid, including partially completed work, source files, and exports. Sections intended to survive termination including Sections 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and Schedule B royalty or audit terms as applicable, remain in effect following termination. Upon termination for cause, any active Deliverable Orders not yet accepted are cancelled and Company has no obligation to accept or pay for unaccepted Deliverables, without prejudice to any other remedies.
10.4 Communication Procedure: For purposes of Section 10.2(a)(iii), Company’s 2 written follow-ups may be sent by email or Discord, and the 5 Business Day period is measured from the date of the first follow-up.
10.5 Royalty Vesting; Continuation; Forfeiture:
(A) Vesting: Contractor’s royalty entitlement under Schedule B vests only upon the Royalty Vesting Event.
(B) Continuation: After vesting, royalties remain payable for the royalty term stated in Schedule B notwithstanding any expiration or termination for convenience under Section 10.1.
(C) Forfeiture: Notwithstanding Section 10.5(B), Contractor’s right to future royalties terminates immediately upon:
(i) Company’s termination for cause under Section 10.2; or
(ii) Contractor’s material breach of Section 5, Section 6, or Section 7 as of the date of such material breach.
(D) No Waiver: Payment of royalties does not waive Company’s other remedies for breach.
(E) Stalling Conduct: Company will not take actions in bad faith primarily intended to prevent the Royalty Vesting Event, such as refusing to issue Required Deliverable Order Requests for Minimum Scope items priced at Schedule B rates, or where justified by written scope and specification changes agreed by the Parties in writing, up to 30% above Schedule B, or terminating for convenience to avoid vesting. This Section 10.5(E) does not apply if Contractor is in material breach or has been terminated for cause.
If (i) Company terminates for convenience before the Royalty Vesting Event occurs after receiving a Stalling Notice and failing to cure under Section 10.5(F), or (ii) Section 10.5(J) applies, then Contractor’s royalty rate vests pro rata as follows:
Vested Royalty Rate = (Completed Minimum Scope Value / Minimum Scope Value) × the royalty rate in B1.
For clarity, if Completed Minimum Scope Value is 60% of Minimum Scope Value, the Vested Royalty Rate equals 60% of the B1 royalty rate. If amendments are made through Deliverable Order Amendments that change prices for Minimum Scope items outlined in Schedule B, then the adjusted values will be used for both scope values. Vested Royalty Rate will not exceed the B1 royalty rate. 
(F) Notice and Cure: Before Contractor may invoke Section 10.5(E), Contractor must provide written notice describing the alleged stalling in reasonable detail(“Stalling Notice”). Company will have 10 Business Days after receipt to cure by taking commercially reasonable steps to proceed with Required Deliverable Order Requests, and to finalize the resulting Deliverable Orders, needed to complete the Minimum Scope. If Company cures within that period, then Section 10.5(E) will not apply to the cured conduct. A Stalling Notice applies only to the conduct described in that notice; Contractor may deliver additional Stalling Notices for subsequent stalling. If Company fails to cure within 10 Business Days, Contractor may terminate for convenience and 10.5(E) still applies subject to Section 10.5(I). If Company gives notice of termination for convenience before the Royalty Vesting Event, Contractor may deliver a Stalling Notice within 10 Business Days after receiving the termination notice, and Section 10.5(F) will apply as if the termination notice were the stalling conduct.
(G) A Stalling Notice is valid only if it:
(i) identifies the specific Minimum Scope item(s) at issue;
(ii) identifies the specific Required Deliverable Order Request(s) the Contractor is ready, willing, and able to accept, including price, Delivery Date, and acceptance criteria consistent with this Agreement;
(iii) describes Company’s conduct alleged to be stalling, including at least dates and proof of relevant messages; and
(iv) states what action Contractor is requesting Company take to proceed.
(H) Cure: Company cures the alleged stalling if, within the 10 Business Day period, Company either:
(i) issues or approves the Required Deliverable Order Request(s) identified in the Stalling Notice, or materially equivalent requests consistent with this Agreement; or
(ii) provides a written response describing a reasonable good-faith business justification for delay and provides a commercially reasonable target date to proceed if applicable.
(I) Dispute: If Company disputes the Stalling Notice in writing within the cure period and provides the response described in Section 10.5(H)(ii), then Section 10.5(E) applies only if a court of competent jurisdiction determines Company acted in bad faith primarily to prevent the Royalty Vesting Event.
(J) Expiration and Non-Renewal: If this Agreement expires under Section 2.1 before the Royalty Vesting Event, and Contractor is not in material breach, and Company elects not to extend the Term after receiving a Stalling Notice and failing to cure as described in Section 10.5(F), then Contractor’s royalty rate vests pro rata under Section 10.5(E) as of the expiration date.
(K) If Contractor terminates for convenience before the Royalty Vesting Event, no royalties are owed unless Section 10.5(E) applies due to Company stalling.
10.6 Effect of Termination for Cause: If Company terminates this Agreement for cause (10.2), Contractor’s right to future royalties immediately terminates (10.5(C)(i)); however, Company remains obligated to pay for accepted Deliverables completed prior to termination.
10.7 Professional Conduct: Contractor will communicate and conduct themselves in a professional manner. Harassment, threats, hate based conduct, or abusive behaviour toward Company personnel or other contractors constitutes a material breach. Company may terminate immediately under Section 10.2 for breach of this Section 10.7.
10.8 No Fault Termination:
If the Parties do not agree in writing on at least one Deliverable Order for a Minimum Scope item (A5) within 5 Business Days after the Effective Date, either Party may terminate this Agreement upon written notice, effective immediately (a “No Fault Early Termination”).
(a) No royalties and no vesting: No royalties, pro rata royalties, or other royalty entitlement under Schedule B will be owed or payable, and the Royalty Vesting Event will be deemed not to have occurred. Sections 10.5(E)–10.5(K) do not apply to a No Fault Early Termination.
(b) Fees: Company will pay Contractor for any Deliverables that were accepted and paid for prior to the effective time of termination, if any.
(c) Survival: Notwithstanding the foregoing, Sections 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, as well as any other provisions intended to survive by their nature, will survive a No Fault Early Termination.
11) Cross-Border Tax and Compliance
11.1 Principal Place of Work: Contractor performs Services from the United States unless otherwise agreed in writing.
11.2 Work in Canada: If Contractor performs any Services in Canada, Company may withhold and remit any amounts required by applicable Canadian law, including Regulation 105, unless Contractor provides a waiver or reduction authorization from CRA.
11.3 Tax Responsibility: Contractor is solely responsible for reporting and paying all U.S. taxes arising from amounts received under this Agreement. Company will not withhold taxes except as required by applicable law.
11.4 Information Requests: Contractor will provide reasonable information including residency or withholding documentation requested by Company to support compliance, and Company may rely on such documentation.
11.5 Statements and Reporting: Company may provide payment statements or reports reflecting amounts paid under this Agreement, including royalties, as required by applicable law.
12) Governing Law; Dispute Resolution
12.1 Governing Law: This Agreement is governed by the laws of the Province of Ontario and the federal laws of Canada applicable therein, excluding conflict of law rules.
12.2 Forum: The Parties attorn to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts located in Ontario, Canada, and agree that any proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement will be brought exclusively in such courts. Each Party waives any objection that such courts are an inconvenient forum.
13) Miscellaneous
13.1 Notices: Any notice under this Agreement must be in writing and may be delivered by 
(a) email, 
(b) courier, or 
(c) Discord message posted in the Parties’ agreed Project communications channel. 
Email notices are deemed given when sent to the notice email address below, provided the sending Party does not receive an automated bounce-back or delivery failure notice. Courier notices are deemed given upon delivery. Discord notices are deemed given when sent, provided the sending Party retains reasonable evidence of delivery. Notices to Company must be sent to [COMPANY EMAIL OR AUTHORIZED PERSON EMAIL HERE]. Notices to Contractor must be sent to [CONTRACTOR EMAIL]. Either Party may update its notice address by giving notice under this Section 13.1. For clarity, the “Project communications channel” is the Discord server currently used by the Parties for Project coordination at the time notice is sent.
13.2 Assignment: Contractor may not assign without Company consent. Company may assign to an affiliate or acquirer.
13.3 Entire Agreement: This Agreement and schedules are the entire agreement between Company and Contractor, and supersede prior discussions.
13.4 Amendments: Must be in writing signed by both Parties. For clarity, Deliverable Orders and approvals under Schedule A may be made as set out in Schedule A and do not require formal signature.
13.5 Severability: Invalid provisions are severed; remainder stays effective.
13.6 Counterparts; Electronic Signatures: This Agreement may be executed in counterparts and by electronic signature such as PDF, each of which is deemed an original.
13.7 Non-Disparagement: During the Term and for 2 years thereafter, neither Party will knowingly make false statements that materially disparage the other Party or its products. This does not restrict truthful statements required by law or statements made in legal proceedings.
13.8 Headings are for convenience only and do not affect interpretation.
