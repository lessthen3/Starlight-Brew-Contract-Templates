Starlight Brew Template License (STBL-1.0)

Copyright © 2026 Starlight Brew Inc.

0) Grant of License

Subject to the terms below, you are granted a worldwide, royalty-free license to use, copy, modify, and redistribute the template documents included in this repository (the “Template Documents”) for personal, educational, or internal business use, including using them to create and sign your own agreements.

Template Documents means the contract templates and related supporting text files in this repository intended for reuse as templates.

Substantially Similar means a version that remains recognizably derived from the Template Documents, including where structure, clause sequence, and core wording are materially the same even if edited or reformatted.

1) No Resale of the Template as a Product

You may not sell, license, or otherwise monetize (including selling access, paywalling, licensing for a fee, or requiring payment to download) the Template Documents (or substantially similar copies) as a standalone product, template pack, “contract kit,” or paid download, whether modified or unmodified.

This restriction does not prohibit:

(a) Using the Template Documents in your own business operations (including signing agreements based on them),

(b) Charging for your own legal services, consulting, or contract drafting work where the Template Documents are used only as a reference or starting point,

(c) Including the Template Documents as part of a larger software product where the Template Documents are not the item being sold.

For clarity, charging money primarily for access to the Template Documents (even if bundled with minimal extras) is prohibited.

2) No Misrepresentation of Authorship

You may not remove the original attribution notices or represent the unmodified template (or a substantially similar copy) as being authored solely by you. If you publish or redistribute, you must retain attribution.

3) Attribution Required on Redistribution

If you redistribute the Template Documents (modified or unmodified), you must:

(a) Retain the original attribution notice(s), and

(b) Include a reference to the original source repository (e.g., in a NOTICE file, README, or prominent header).

3.1) Internal Use: For internal business use attribution is not required for the Template Documents (including use in agreements you sign), but is required for any redistribution under Section 3.

4) Not Legal Advice; Use at Your Own Risk

The Template Documents are provided for personal, educational, or business use purposes only and do not constitute legal advice. No lawyer-client relationship is formed. The Template Documents may not be accurate, complete, or up to date.

Laws and legal requirements vary by jurisdiction and by the specific facts of each situation. You should consult a qualified lawyer licensed in your jurisdiction before using or relying on these materials.

5) Disclaimer of Warranties

The Template Documents are provided “AS IS” and “AS AVAILABLE,” without warranties of any kind, express or implied, including merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

6) Limitation of Liability

To the fullest extent permitted by law, Starlight Brew Inc. and contributors will not be liable for any damages arising out of or relating to the use of, or inability to use, the Template Documents, including direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

You are responsible for ensuring that any agreement you use is appropriate for your situation and complies with applicable laws, regulations, and tax requirements.

7) Termination

If you breach Sections 1–3, your license to use and redistribute the Template Documents terminates automatically without notice. Upon termination, you must cease redistribution of the Template Documents and any substantially similar copies.
