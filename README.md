# Starlight Brew Contract Templates

This repository contains contract templates primarily intended for educational or informational use by indie game devs to use while contracting someone for help in their game; and as a practical starting point for independent contractor agreement (common law jurisdictions) that may be adapted for other jurisdictions (including civil law) with appropriate legal review.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> This is not legal advice. See LICENSE for more information. I highly recommend seeking legal consultation before giving out this contract, this contract is provided "as-is" and you should use at your own discretion.

> [!NOTE] 
> This contract by default assumes revenue sharing represented as a time limited royalty that continues after contract termination. If you just want a flat fee payment model then adjusting the template should be relatively easy.
