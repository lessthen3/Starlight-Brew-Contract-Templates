# Starlight Brew Contract Templates

This repository contains contract templates primarily intended for educational or informational use by indie game developers and artists who want a reference when contracting help for a project. These templates are meant to serve as a practical starting point for independent contractor agreements in common law jurisdictions, and they may be adapted for other jurisdictions (including civil law systems) with appropriate legal review.

> [!IMPORTANT] 
> This is not legal advice. See LICENSE for more information. __I highly recommend seeking legal consultation before giving out anything based off this contract__, this contract is provided "as-is" and you should use at your own discretion.

> [!NOTE] 
> This contract by default assumes revenue sharing represented as a time limited royalty that continues after contract termination. If you just want a reference for a flat fee payment model, this contract template is still helpful since it would just be a subset of the current contract template.
